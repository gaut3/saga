## [1.0.1] – 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Import progress: clicking Restore dismissed the settings screen instead of the dialog. The confirmation dialog buttons were using the settings screen's navigator context rather than the dialog's own context — since `showDialog` pushes onto the root navigator, `Navigator.pop(settingsContext)` popped the wrong route. Same bug fixed in Clear progress dialog.
- Import progress: file picker could hang without completing the import on some Android versions (SAF + `withData: true` interaction). Now reads via file path.
- All snackbars replaced app-wide with a custom overlay toast appearing at the top of the screen, avoiding bottom navigation margin issues entirely. Toasts are tappable to dismiss early. Error toasts (playback error, server unreachable, failed import/export) stay visible for 4 seconds; informational toasts dismiss after 2.5 seconds.
- Settings screen version display was hardcoded to `v1.0.0`. Now reads from `pubspec.yaml` at runtime via `package_info_plus`.

### Changed
- User-facing text pass: "Relisten" → "Listen again"; "From Start" → "From start"; "times read" → "times listened"; "reading/book positions" → "listening positions"; server connection count now uses correct singular/plural; search hint no longer mentions genre (genre is not searchable); "Up next · " separator changed to "Up next in "; "Skip back a little when resuming after a pause" reworded to "Rewind slightly when resuming playback".
